        <h2>PROJECT’S</h2>
        <p>Drowsiness Detection System Using Open CV</p>
        <p>Developed a Machine Learning model using Deep-Learning Algorithm, to detect Drowsiness Detection system along with validating input ﬁle for a valid data set. 
            The output indicates if a person feel’s drowsiness or not. This was done as a main project during my academic’s time to improve my understanding of algorithms 
            and learn how machine learning can solve real life problems.</p>

        <h2>PUBLICATION</h2>
        <p>• Published a journal on Drowsiness Detection System with Machine Learning and open cv in - IJCRT International with a team of 4 and a mentor.</p>
        <p>•  Drowsiness Detection System is used to Detect Drowsiness of a person while driving. Driver fatigue typically becomes an instantaneous reason behind several traffic accidents.
             In this manner, there’s a thought to create the framework that will distinguish and inform a driver of his/her terrible psychophysical condition. 
             Which may essentially diminish the number of fatigue-related car mishaps </p>

<p>The provided HTML document is a simple resume for an individual named Jitendra Pappala, a web developer. The document is structured into
     sections including header, education, projects, technical skills,coursework, general skills, extracurricular activities, and publications. 
     Each section is separated by horizontal lines for clarity.In the header, Jitendra's name is prominently displayed along with the designation 
     "Web Developer." The education section includes details about his university and graduation year. The projects section describes a specific project 
     related to a Drowsiness Detection System using OpenCV and machine learning.The technical skills section lists various programming languages, 
     including Python, C, C++, and Java. The coursework section outlines academic subjects, ranging from data mining to software engineering. 
     The skills section briefly mentions proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.The extracurricular activities section highlights Jitendra's 
     volunteer work in tech and cultural fests. The publication section discusses a published journal on the Drowsiness Detection System.The footer contains a 
     dynamic date and time display using JavaScript. However, there is an incomplete script tag inside the script element, and it seems to have an unfinished 
     "Addendum" section. It might be intended for additional content, but it's currently incomplete. The code could be improved by fixing the script tag 
     and providing the necessary content for the "Addendum" section. </p>
